# Introduction

## Overview

The NYC 311 Service Requests dataset contains reports related to various city issues, including sewer-related complaints. This analysis focuses on two primary sewer-related complaints for 2024:

1. **Street Flooding (SF)**: Reports of standing water or street flooding.
2. **Catch Basin (CB)**: Reports of clogged or defective catch basins that prevent proper drainage.

These complaints provide insights into both immediate street flooding issues and underlying infrastructural challenges.

## Exploring Data

```{python}
import pandas as pd

# Load the dataset
file_path = "data/nycflood2024.csv"
df = pd.read_csv(file_path)

# Display basic info about the dataset
df_info = df.info()

# Show first few rows
df_head = df.head(3)

df_info, df_head

```

The dataset contains Street Flooding (SF) and Catch Basin (CB) complaints from 
2024, extracted from 9,483 service requests. Key columns relevant to the 
analysis include that:  
 
- **Descriptor**: Specifies whether the complaint is about Street Flooding or
  Catch Basin Clogged/Flooding.  
- **Created Date**: Indicates when the complaint was reported.  
- **Borough**: Provides the location of the complaint within NYC.  
- **Latitude/Longitude**: Contains geographic coordinates for spatial analysis  
  and mapping.
